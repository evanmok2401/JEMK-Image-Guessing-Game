In the example above, the top image displayed was a gif of a ball falling and the bottom image displayed a ledger. These images are generated in real time, extracted from wikipedia's thumbnails.The words are generated at the backend using the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) for [stemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) and [lemmatisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation).
