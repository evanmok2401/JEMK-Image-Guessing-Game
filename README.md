In the example above, the top image is a sweater while the bottom is a strawberry shortcake. These images are generated in real time, extracted from wikipedia's thumbnails.The words are generated at the backend using the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) for [stemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) and [lemmatisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation).

Just in case you were wondering, the answer is *"swe"* for *sweater* and *sweet*.
